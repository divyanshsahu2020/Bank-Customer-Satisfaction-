# Bank-Customer-Satisfaction-
- DESCRIPTION - To predict whether the customer is satisfied with bankâ€™s service, will stay or leave the bank. This analysis can be done by creating a predictive artificial neural network model.
- DATASET - The data for this project was collected through online sources (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset). The data is a csv file which consists of several columns like 
            customer_id, credit_score, countary, gender, age, tenure, balance, products_number, credit_card, active_member and estimated_salary.
- OUTPUT - The output column, churn, uses binary digits to predict whether the customer is satisfied or not, i.e., 1 indicates that the client has left the bank, whereas, 0 indicates he/she has not.
           The supervised predictive model has an accuracy of 89%.
